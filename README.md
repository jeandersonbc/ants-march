==========

This is a demo for the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to solve the
Travelling Salesman Problem.

## Dependencies

Nothing but Python 2.x is all you need to run the demo:
``python ./main.py``

## Problem

Given 60 cities (assume you can reach all the other 59 cities from your location),
how long would you take to find the best path to visit all cities? Are you really up
to compute all possibilities?
